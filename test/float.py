''' Basics of floating-point representation
    A floating-point number for the purposes of this exercise is a pair (e, m), where `e` is a `k`-bit exponent and `m` is a `p`+1-bit mantissa. `p` is called the precision of the mantissa/number.
    The exponent `e` represents values in the range [-2^{k-1}, 2^{k-1}), but is stored as a non-negative `k`-bit integer by adding a constant `bias` = 2^{k-1} to it.
    The mantissa `m` lies in the range [2^p, 2^p+1), i.e., its `p`-th bit is always set, and it represents the following real value: m/2^p.
    The only exception to the mantissa range is the value 0, in which case both the exponent and mantissa are 0.
    Overall, the value represented by a floating-point number is: m/2^p * 2^{e-bias}.

''' Enforces the well-formedness of an exponent-mantissa pair (e, m)
    if `e` is zero, then `m` must be zero
    else, `e` must be at most `k` bits long, and `m` must be normalized, i.e., lie in the range [2^p, 2^p+1)

        ''' To check if mantissa is in the range [2^p, 2^(p+1))

    The input is a floating-point number with a `k`-bit exponent `e` and a `P`+1-bit *unnormalized* mantissa `m` with precision `p` (i.e., m does not necessarily lie in [2^p, 2^{p+1}) ), where `m` is assumed to be non-zero.
    The output is a floating-point number representing the exact same value with exponent `e_out` and a `P`+1-bit *normalized* mantissa `m_out` with precision `P` (i.e., m_out lies in [2^P, 2^{P+1}) ).

        Consequently, we need to decrement the exponent by P-ell.
        At the same time, we are also increasing precision of mantissa from p to P, so we also need to increment the exponent by P-p.

    Rounding is necessary to prevent the bitlength of the mantissa from growing with each successive operation.
